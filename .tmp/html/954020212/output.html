<h1>Solving the Equation 2x + 3 = 4</h1>

<p>In this explanation, we will go through the step-by-step process of solving the equation 2x + 3 = 4. This equation is a simple linear equation, and we will use basic algebraic techniques to find the value of x.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Write Down the Equation</h2>

<p>The given equation is:</p>

$$2x + 3 = 4$$

<p>This is the equation we want to solve for x.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Isolate the Term with x</h2>

<p>Our goal is to isolate the term with x, which is 2x. To do this, we need to get rid of the constant term +3 on the left-hand side of the equation.</p>

<p>We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:</p>

$$2x + 3 - 3 = 4 - 3$$

<p>This simplifies to:</p>

$$2x = 1$$

<p>Now, the term with x is isolated.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Solve for x</h2>

<p>Finally, we need to solve for x. To do this, we need to get rid of the coefficient 2 that is multiplied by x.</p>

<p>We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:</p>

$$\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$$

<p>This simplifies to:</p>

$$x = \frac{1}{2}$$

<p>And that's it! We have found the value of x.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this explanation, we solved the equation 2x + 3 = 4 by isolating the term with x and then solving for x. The final answer is x = 1/2.</p>
