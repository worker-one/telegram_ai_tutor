  <h1>Solving the Differential Equation 2x' + 2x = 6</h1>

  <p>
    In this explanation, we will go through the step-by-step solution to the differential equation 2x' + 2x = 6.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Write the differential equation</h2>

  <p>
    The given differential equation is:
  </p>

  $$2\frac{dx}{dt} + 2x = 6$$

  <h2>Step 2: Divide both sides by 2</h2>

  <p>
    Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to simplify the coefficients:
  </p>

  $$\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 3$$

  <h2>Step 3: Rearrange the equation to separate variables</h2>

  <p>
    Rearrange the equation to separate the variables x and t:
  </p>

  $$\frac{dx}{dt} = 3 - x$$

  <h2>Step 4: Integrate both sides</h2>

  <p>
    Integrate both sides of the equation with respect to t:
  </p>

  $$\int \frac{dx}{3-x} = \int dt$$

  <h2>Step 5: Evaluate the integrals</h2>

  <p>
    Evaluate the integrals on both sides:
  </p>

  $$-\ln|3-x| = t + C$$

  <h2>Step 6: Solve for x</h2>

  <p>
    Solve for x by isolating the variable on one side of the equation:
  </p>

  $$x = 3 - Ce^{-t}$$

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    The general solution to the differential equation 2x' + 2x = 6 is x = 3 - Ce^{-t}, where C is the constant of integration.
